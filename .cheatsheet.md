## TMUX

Tmux is based on commands that perform specific tasks. However, in order to
execute these commands, a prefix must first be used. The prefix tells Tmux that
a command is going to be executed. By default, the prefix is `CTRL+B`.

So the correct way to structure commands in Tmux is:

```
<prefix> + Command
```

That is, we have to press the keys `CTRL+B` and then the command. For example,
to create a new session, the command would be `C`. 

### Windows (tabs)

```
<prefix> + c  create window
<prefix> + w  list windows
<prefix> + l  next window
<prefix> + h  previous window
<prefix> + f  find window
<prefix> + ,  name window
<prefix> + x  kill window
```

### Panes (splits)

```
<prefix> + shift + -  vertical split
<prefix> + -          horizontal split
<prefix> + o          swap panes
<prefix> + q          show pane numbers
<prefix> + +          maximize pane
<prefix> + -          restore pane from window
<prefix> +            space - toggle between layouts
<prefix> {            (Move the current pane left)
<prefix> }            (Move the current pane right)
<prefix> z            toggle pane zoom
```
